        <h1>EveryPicture - interactive website</h1>
        <h1><a href="https://baimengf.github.io/des117a-winter24-/Final/final/index.html" class="prototype">Interactive Website</a><br><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/boUfTJwTn6iSC5J4DftC8w/everypicture-user-test?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=QmTcHzNpEfW5n292-0">Mock Prototype</a></h1>
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>Embark on a digital trip through memory lane with EveryPicture: it blends modern design with timeless polaroid aesthetics to evoke nostalgia. As users explore our site, they'll notice a unique polaroid-style overlay adding retro charm. Continuously refining the site for optimal performance, I tackle issues like slow image duplication, particularly on slower connections. Besides functionality, I prioritize enhancing user engagement -- the animation features elevate the overlay experience, while descriptive text/icons ensure seamless navigation. To add a touch of fun, I've included a feedback feature, allowing users to share thoughts inspired by images with a simple click. With images categorized for easy exploration, users can enjoy a diverse and immersive journey through our collection.</p>
        <h2>Usability testing - Interviews</h2>
        <p>During the interview, I observed the users navigating through the mock prototype, during this process I spotted aspects that are confusing to the users I didn't realize before; I also asked them about their impression on the website and what they would like to see.</p>
