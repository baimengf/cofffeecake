        <h1>EveryPicture - interactive website</h1>
        <h1><a href="https://baimengf.github.io/des117a-winter24-/Final/final/index.html" class="prototype">Interactive Website</a><br><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/boUfTJwTn6iSC5J4DftC8w/everypicture-user-test?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=QmTcHzNpEfW5n292-0">Mock Prototype</a></h1>
        <p>Step into a digital journey down memory lane with EveryPicture: the project is designed to evoke nostalgia by seamlessly blending modern design with the timeless charm of polaroid aesthetics. As users navigate through our website, they'll notice a unique overlay featuring a polaroid background, adding a touch of retro flair to their experience. I'm constantly refining the website to ensure optimal performance, including addressing issues like slow image duplication on slower internet connections. In addition to enhancing functionality, I'm also focusing on improving user engagement. The animations enhance the overlay experience and descriptive text/icons guide the user through the site, eliminating any sense of confusion. I also tried to gamify the experience with the feedback feature. Users can share reflections and random thoughts inspired by the images by simply clicking on the "feedback" button. Exploring images from different locations categorized for easy navigation offers a diverse and immersive journey through the collection of images.</p>
        <h2>User 1</h2>

        <p>Positively responded to the aesthetics of the page.
        Suggested that the button color lacks contrast with the background, making it difficult to find.
        Found the gallery layout intuitive and easy to navigate.
        Reacted positively to the feedback process.</p>
        <h2>User 2</h2>
        
        <p>Suggested using post tags for the locations button to evoke a sense of travel. Recommended integrating the feedback section into an overlay within the slider for improved visibility and functionality.Expressed confusion regarding the purpose of the feedback section due to lack of description.Recommended adjusting the wording of the feedback button or integrating it into the slider overlay for clarity.Advised checking the button's contrast with the background.Noted that the doodle resembles a button and suggested adding functionality to it.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>Adjust button wording to clarify their purpose, e.g., "send me a message." Enhance button visibility by improving contrast with the background. Integrate feedback section into slider overlay for improved clarity and accessibility. Consider adding functionality to the doodle to enhance user engagement. Provide descriptive text for gallery images to enhance user understanding.<br>
        Overall, the prototype design is effective, but improvements are needed to enhance button visibility, clarify button functions, and integrate feedback section for improved usability. Incorporating user suggestions will likely result in a more intuitive and user-friendly design.</p>
